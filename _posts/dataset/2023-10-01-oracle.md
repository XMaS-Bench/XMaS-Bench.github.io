### Introduction

The **Oracle dataset** provides a comprehensive collection of graphs sampled from two popular datasets: [**OGB**](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/dataset_overview/) and [**TUDataset**](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/). Containing **26,435 graphs**, the dataset facilitates advanced graph analysis through induced and non-induced subgraph counting, as well as the generation of graph features like diameter, density, and clustering coefficient.

This post walks through the key features of the Oracle dataset and its relevance in subgraph counting and graph sampling.

### Dataset Overview

- **Number of Graphs**: 26,435
- **Source Datasets**: [OGB](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/dataset_overview/), [TUDataset](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/)
- **Graph Features**: Diameter, density, clustering coefficient
- **Subgraph Counting**: Induced and non-induced, both local and global
- **Ego Network Constraint**: **ID-constrained ego networks** are used, which reduces overlaps between ego networks, facilitating better predictions.

### Subgraph Counting

We compute both **local** and **global subgraph counts** for each graph in the dataset:

- **Induced subgraph counts**: Measure the number of subgraphs where the induced subgraph is isomorphic to a given pattern.
- **Non-induced subgraph counts**: Measure the presence of a pattern without requiring the subgraph to be induced.

This dual approach to subgraph counting provides detailed insight into the structural complexity of each graph.

### Ego Networks and DeSCo

The **ID-constrained ego network** methodology, as used in the [DeSCo paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08198), is central to the Oracle dataset. By leveraging ID-constrained ego networks, we reduce the overlap between subgraphs, which helps in more accurate prediction tasks. This dataset also provides **ground truth** for both induced and non-induced subgraphs under these constraints.

### Graph Features

In addition to subgraph counts, we compute a series of **graph features**:

- **Diameter**: The longest shortest path between any two nodes in the graph.
- **Density**: A measure of how many edges exist compared to the number of possible edges.
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Indicates the degree to which nodes in the graph tend to cluster together.

These features, combined with the subgraph counting data, provide rich context for **sampling algorithms**. The dataset can be used to design samplers that respect these constraints, enabling more efficient and accurate graph analysis.
